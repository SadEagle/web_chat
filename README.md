### About the project

Current project is a simple web-chat application implementation. Not everything was implementated. Main idea to make some project from 0 and show my skills. 

This repo in development process, main point to make something full-stack and fun.

Inspiration sources:
- [full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template)

This project was written with NixOS and it's instruments. Full-stack dev env process with nix looks unintuitives, so duplicate with ubuntu based docker/compose.
