### About the project

Current project is a simple web-chat application implementation

It serves as a full-stack demonstration of my skills for my future work with a backend focus, it intentionaly avoids any complex web frameworks. The main goal is to develop a small monorepo project incorporating all the essential tools of a full-stack development workflow. Some instruments were replaced with Nix-based alternatives.

This repo in development process, main point to make something full-stack and fun.
